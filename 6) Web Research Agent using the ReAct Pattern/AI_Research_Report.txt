### ‚ùì Question 1: Here are 6 well-structured and diverse research questions covering different aspects of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare:
('Here are 6 well-structured and diverse research questions covering different aspects of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare:', '- AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their ‚Äòquadruple aim‚Äô by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1).30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring. | **Long term: >10 years** | Autonomous virtual health assistants, delivering predictive and anticipatory care Networked and connected care organisations (single digital infrastructure) | Holographic and hybrid imaging Holomics (integrated genomic/radiomic/proteomic/clinical/immunohistochemical data) | Genomics medicine AI driven drug discovery | New curative treatments AI empowered healthcare professionals (eg digital twins) | AI enables healthcare systems to achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care |\n- The impact of AI is observed in detecting clinical conditions in medical imaging and diagnostic services, controlling the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with early diagnosis, providing virtual patient care using AI-powered tools, managing electronic health records, augmenting patient engagement and compliance with the treatment plan, reducing the administrative workload of healthcare professionals (HCPs), discovering new drugs and vaccines, spotting medical prescription errors, extensive data storage and analysis, and technology-assisted rehabilitation. The rise of biomedical science, including genomics, digital medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), and its subset, namely, machine learning (ML), provides the backdrop to healthcare transformation, with novel emerging technologies, and there is a prerequisite of a new type of labor force and standard of practice.\n- What is AI bias? Not yet, AI technology may inherit human biases due to biases in training data In this article, we focus on AI bias and will answer all important questions regarding biases in artificial intelligence algorithms from types and examples of AI biases to removing those biases from AI algorithms. Racism Racism in AI happens when algorithms show unfair bias against certain racial or ethnic groups. Sexism Sexism in AI manifests when systems favor one gender over another, often prioritizing male candidates for jobs or defaulting to male symptoms in health apps. AI bias is an anomaly in the output of machine learning algorithms, due to the prejudiced assumptions made during the algorithm development process or prejudices in the training data.')

### ‚ùì Question 2: 1.  **Clinical Efficacy and Patient Outcomes:**
('1.  **Clinical Efficacy and Patient Outcomes:**', "- 1 The aim of this article is to clarify the meaning of clinical 'efficacy', 'effectiveness' and 'outcomes'. Efficacy and effectiveness of clinical treatment. '\n- The SF-36 was the first set of instruments developed to reliably measure health and mental status of adults and to quantify the outcomes of health interventions from the patient‚Äôs perspective.12‚Äì14 Since then, the SF-36 (including derivatives) has been implemented to measure the quality of life of older adults15,16, patients with chronic diseases,17,18 surgical patients,19‚Äì22 among other conditions and has been translated and validated in multiple different languages.23,24 More recently, the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement System (PROMIS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health and leverages item response theory to address measurement and reliability problems and minimize responder burden.25,26 PROMIS contains over 300 measures of health-related physical, mental, and social well-being (Table 1).27 PROMIS domains are easily translatable and have been validated for healthy patients and patients with many health conditions and include pediatric domains.\n- Evidence-based practice improves patient outcomes and healthcare system return on investment: Findings from a scoping review - PubMed Evidence-based practice improves patient outcomes and healthcare system return on investment: Findings from a scoping review Evidence-based practice improves patient outcomes and healthcare system return on investment: Findings from a scoping review Background: Evidence-based practice and decision-making have been consistently linked to improved quality of care, patient safety, and many positive clinical outcomes in isolated reports throughout the literature.

### ‚ùì Question 3: *   How effectively can Artificial Intelligence models enhance *diagnostic accuracy* and *treatment efficacy* across diverse medical specialties, and what are the key *patient outcomes* associated with their clinical integration compared to traditional methods?
('*   How effectively can Artificial Intelligence models enhance *diagnostic accuracy* and *treatment efficacy* across diverse medical specialties, and what are the key *patient outcomes* associated with their clinical integration compared to traditional methods?', '- AI has revolutionized medical diagnostics by enhancing accuracy and efficiency through algorithmic interpretation. It characterizes digital\n- In healthcare, the most common application of traditional machine learning is precision medicine ‚Äì predicting what treatment protocols are likely to succeed on a patient based on various patient attributes and the treatment context.2 The great majority of machine learning and precision medicine applications require a training dataset for which the outcome variable (eg onset of disease) is known; this is called supervised learning. However, early enthusiasm for this application of the technology has faded as customers realised the difficulty of teaching Watson how to address particular types of cancer9 and of integrating Watson into care processes and systems.10 Watson is not a single product but a set of ‚Äòcognitive services‚Äô provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), including speech and language, vision, and machine learning-based data-analysis programs.\n- AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their ‚Äòquadruple aim‚Äô by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1).30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring. | **Long term: >10 years** | Autonomous virtual health assistants, delivering predictive and anticipatory care Networked and connected care organisations (single digital infrastructure) | Holographic and hybrid imaging Holomics (integrated genomic/radiomic/proteomic/clinical/immunohistochemical data) | Genomics medicine AI driven drug discovery | New curative treatments AI empowered healthcare professionals (eg digital twins) | AI enables healthcare systems to achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care |')

### ‚ùì Question 4: 2.  **Ethical Implications and Equity:**
('2.  **Ethical Implications and Equity:**', '- Equity absolutely is a core business ethic, just like integrity and truthfulness. And it\'s woven into our Code in many ways.\n- One of the biggest ethical issues that schools face is social inequity. Education institutions often fail to address the problems that arise thanks to the\n- The first protective principle stemming from the 1978 Belmont Report is the principle of Respect for Persons, also known as human dignity.This dictates researchers must work to protect research participants\' autonomy while also ensuring full disclosure of factors surrounding the study, including potential harms and benefits. In the case of minors, assent is also an element that must be addressed per Subpart D of the Code of Federal Regulations, 45 CFR 46.402, which defines consent as "a child\'s affirmative agreement to participate in research; mere failure to object should not, absent affirmative agreement, be construed as assent." There is a lack in the literature on when minors can understand research, although current research suggests that the age by which a minor could assent is around 14.Anytime researchers include vulnerable groups in their studies, they must have extra safeguards to uphold the Belmont Report\'s ethical principles, especially beneficence.')

### ‚ùì Question 5: *   How can ethical considerations, including *algorithmic bias, data privacy, and accountability*, be effectively addressed in the development and deployment of AI in healthcare to ensure *equitable access and patient trust* across diverse demographic groups?
('*   How can ethical considerations, including *algorithmic bias, data privacy, and accountability*, be effectively addressed in the development and deployment of AI in healthcare to ensure *equitable access and patient trust* across diverse demographic groups?', '- One of the most profound applications of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics [3‚Äì5], where machine learning algorithms are being deployed to interpret medical data, such as medical imaging, lab results, and patient histories, more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods. AI systems must be designed to comply with stringent data protection laws [23], such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU; https://gdpr-info.eu/) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html), to ensure that patient information is kept secure and confidential.

### ‚ùì Question 6: 3.  **Operational Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness:**
('3.  **Operational Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness:**', "- *   Operational efficiency helps product and service-based businesses drive process improvement for reduced costs and increased profit margin. *   The main operating strategies include setting goals and tracking key performance indicators, supporting collaboration and transparency, and utilizingPSA tools for automation, time management, and more. Operational efficiency is a process used by businesses and professional service firms to ensure the optimal use of resources, such as employees, facilities, and finances. *   Leveraging agency management software to automate processes, manage human resources and their time efficiently, and facilitate various other functions.\n- Though cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency are two similar terms often used interchangeably, the reality is that they are two different concepts.\n- Efficiency means doing more with less (or the same) financial, physical and human resources. It's maximizing output. Effectiveness is the quality that those")

### ‚ùì Question 7: *   To what extent can Artificial Intelligence optimize *operational efficiency* and reduce *healthcare costs* in administrative processes, resource allocation (e.g., bed management, staffing), and clinical workflow management within hospital systems?
('*   To what extent can Artificial Intelligence optimize *operational efficiency* and reduce *healthcare costs* in administrative processes, resource allocation (e.g., bed management, staffing), and clinical workflow management within hospital systems?', '- AI in hospital administration enhances efficiency by optimizing resource allocation, decision-making, and patient management.\n- By reducing administrative burdens, enhancing clinical decision-making, and streamlining operations, agentic AI has the potential to transform healthcare delivery and improve both outcomes and cost-effectiveness. In administration, AI can automate scheduling, documentation, insurance claims, and billing, which reduces the burden on physicians and minimizes human error, but these efficiencies are greatly enhanced when AI systems operate with agentic qualities that enable real-time adjustments based on changing priorities and feedback loops. AI-supported clinical decision-making can enhance patient care by delivering real-time, data-driven insights that facilitate early diagnoses, personalize treatments, and improve drug management. Through the use of agentic AI, these systems would not only monitor patient data but also autonomously adjust treatment recommendations in response to real-time health changes.\n- AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their ‚Äòquadruple aim‚Äô by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1).30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring. | **Long term: >10 years** | Autonomous virtual health assistants, delivering predictive and anticipatory care Networked and connected care organisations (single digital infrastructure) | Holographic and hybrid imaging Holomics (integrated genomic/radiomic/proteomic/clinical/immunohistochemical data) | Genomics medicine AI driven drug discovery | New curative treatments AI empowered healthcare professionals (eg digital twins) | AI enables healthcare systems to achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care |')

From the Magazine (July‚ÄìAugust 2018) This is raising reasonable fears that AI will ultimately replace human workers throughout the economy. While AI will radically alter how work gets done and who does it, the technology‚Äôs larger impact will be in complementing and augmenting human capabilities, not replacing them.\n- *   **Study workers‚Äô use of AI and its silent impacts.**Half of leaders in a Deloitte survey say they recognize the need to study how different types of workers work with AI to help them create better human and business outcomes.40They can use any number of methods, including anthropological research, surveys, focus groups, and sentiment analysis; they can even use AI itself to collect data on the effectiveness of human and machine collaboration. *   **Forge a relationship between the HR and tech functions.** Creating a new value proposition for the age of AI requires expertise from both the tech and people domains.In a recent Deloitte survey, 30% of executives said they believe that to create better human and business outcomes, they need their chief information and chief digital officers to join forces with the chief human resources officer to optimize human and machine collaboration and help people work with AI.')
